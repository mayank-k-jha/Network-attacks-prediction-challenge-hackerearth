# Network-attacks-prediction-challenge-hackerearth
In this challenge, we are given an anonymised sample dataset of server connections. We have to predict the type of attack(s).
This has been the most fantastic Machine learning competition for me. It has been a 1 month long competition where for the first time, I have used my own stacked architecture of models to earn a top 1% (40 rank out of 4656 participants ) spot on the Leaderboard.
